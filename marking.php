								<h3> <b>What Is Marking?</b> </h3>
								<p>In the context of the Trollbox, marking is a reputation
								and tipping system. When you mark another user, you are
								awarding them reputation points and a small amount of BTM.
								You may mark other users for saying something useful,
								interesting, amusing, or for any other reason.
								</p><br/> 
								<p> <h3> <b>How Do I Mark Other Users?</b> </h3> </p>
								<p>Once you have enabled marking on this page, you can mark other users by typing a command in the Trollbox. The syntax is: </p>
								<p> 
									<div class="alert alert-success"> /mark 
										<username> < amount> [reason]
									</div>
								</p>
								<p>[reason] is optional. If specified, it will be displayed to other users and recorded in the marking ledger, along with the username and amount. </p>
								<p>Each mark is worth 0.001 BTM. When you mark another user, 0.001 <b>BTM per mark will be deducted from your balance and added to the other user's balance.</b> Additionally, the other user's reputation scores will increase according to a custom algorithm.</p>
								<p> For example, suppose user Mary types /mark Jane 50 in the Trollbox. The following will happen:<br> Mary's BTM balance will decrease by 0.05 BTM <br>Jane's BTM balance will increase by 0.05 BTM <br>Jane's reputation score will increase according to our custom algorithm</p>
								<p> The algorithm is designed to give an accurate representation of reputation and discourage gaming. For example, it provides a greater reputation score to users who have been marked by a variety of other users â€” in other words, a user who receives 10 marks each from 10 different users will have a greater reputation score than a user who receives 100 marks from a single user. Please note that the algorithm is in beta and subject to change, and that changes will be applied retroactively. To check a user's reputation score, type:</p>
								<div class="alert alert-success"> /rep < username > </div>
								<p>Remember, when you mark someone, check your amounts carefully, as markings cannot be reversed for any reason.</p>
								<h3> <b>Rules</b> </h3>
								<p>In order to protect users and reduce spam, there are some limitations to how much and how often you can mark.</p>
								<p><b>If you do not have 2FA enabled:</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>You can mark once per minute</li>
                                    <li>You can award up to 50 marks at a time</li>
								</ul>
								<p><b>If you do have 2FA enabled:</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>You can mark once every 10 seconds</li>
                                    <li>You can award up to 1000 marks at a time</li>
								</ul><br><br>
